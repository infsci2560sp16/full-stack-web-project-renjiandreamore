                        <p>Who am I ?<br>
                        My name is Jian Ren, but many people call me "Professor" in Chinese. I am in the general track of MSIS program. I finished my undergraduate study in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in applied physics. After that, i was trying to continue my master's degree in Financial Engineering because I was fascinated by the life in Wall Street, and finally I got admitted by the University of Chicago. But after that, I asked myself "what is your true love?", I found I was actually allured by the fame and label created by the seemingly superficial stuff such as money and position. So I decided to quit school and try every possibilities to find my own interests. I did a lot of things, did internship in consulting companies, started my own business with my best friends, etc. Finally I thought that technologies are the things that fascinating me, but I do not want to be a programmer for my whole life. I like to create things, invent things, organize a lot of people to fulfill a difficult tasks. Moreover, I have a pretty incisive and unique view of products and business visions, I am good at convincing people, challenging and pushing myself to a brand new level, and not afraid of taking risks. Information technology is changing day by day, so I enrolled this program and all I need to do is to get more technical skills to make me step into high tech companies to gain experience. the rookie programmer Jian sell basic programming skills, profession knowledges and opinions, but the "Professor" not only want to be aides and staff, a counselor, but he also wants to be a chancellor, dare to die and take risks, using inner genius to fight in real earnest.</p>
